`In the quiet of the night, stars gleam,Dreams twirl in a cosmic, silent scheme.Moonlight whispers, a soft lullaby,As time dances, and hours fly by. <br><br>Basketball bouncing, a rhythmic beat,Coding languages, a dance so sweet.In the realm where passions collide,A teenager's journey, an adventurous ride. <br><br>Money's pursuit, a quest untold,Yet in every endeavor, let hearts unfold.Yunus, the architect of dreams,In each sunrise, a new story beams. <br><br>May your days be filled with joy and cheer,As you navigate through the atmosphere.Basketball, coding, and fortune's kiss,Embrace the journey, embrace the bliss.`;

const Humpty = `My heart's like humpty dumptyEverytime it shatters to a million piecesPiece by piece I fix my heartBut there's not enough piecesI'm getting tired of fixing my heart I don't really have good puzzle skillsI am puzzled at how my heart still functions It's been shattered one to many timesAnd an explanation would be goodI'd love to understand how my heart has the ability to loveHow i still fall head over heels for someone even when I can't stand on my feetI'm desperate for an answer, I need to end this trend.

const pain = ` In the shadows of the night,
Where whispers echo, pain takes flight.
A dance with sorrow, a silent cry,
In every tear, the reasons lie.<br>
<br>
Through the cracks, the heartache seeps,
A story of pain that silently weeps.
Yet in the struggle, resilience found,
A strength emerges, breaking the ground.<br>
<br>
Battles fought within, unseen scars,
In the canvas of life, where pain mars.
But remember, Yunus, in the darkest hour,
There blooms a resilience, a hidden flower.<br>
<br>
So embrace the pain, let it be your guide,
For in its depths, strength will abide.
Like a phoenix rising from the flame,
In pain, you'll find your powerful name.
